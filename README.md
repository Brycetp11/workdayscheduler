Deployed application: https://brycetp11.github.io/workdayscheduler/index.html

In this project the goal was to make an hourly planner complete with an hours tab, text area, and save button for each row. The save button saved the text to local storage, and will populate into the correct hour field when the page is reloaded as before.

I created all the elements after the header dynamically using jquery.

The text areas will have different background color depending on the time of day.
